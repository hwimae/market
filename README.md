# Fruit Store CLI

A simple command-line shopping cart application built with Node.js and TypeScript.

## Description

This application simulates a basic fruit store. It displays a list of available fruits and their prices, prompts the user to select items and quantities, and calculates the total cost of the items in the cart, printing a final bill upon exit.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open a terminal in the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

To run the application, execute the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will compile the TypeScript code and start the application. Follow the on-screen prompts to add fruits to your cart. Press 'q' to quit and see the final bill.
